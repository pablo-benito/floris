# Main Input File Reference

In addition to calling the `set()` method on {py:class}`FlorisModel`, users can configure FLORIS
with an input file. The file must be YAML format with either "yaml" or "yml" extension.
The below definitions guide a user to the top, mid, and lower level parameterizations. A few
reference input files are available in the
[floris/examples](https://github.com/NatLabRockies/floris/tree/main/examples/inputs) folder.
